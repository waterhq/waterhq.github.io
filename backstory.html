  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <p>Once upon a time we went downtown and saw the polluted rivers filled with piles of trash, glass, metal cans, and other very dangerous plastics. So after many hours of thinking we were inspired to make Water HQ, a river pollution reduction company.We produce robots that clean the rivers to help fend off climate change and eliminate sea life extinction.
